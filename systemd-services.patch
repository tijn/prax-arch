+# A way to run Prax on Arch Linux
+
+We need to do a few things:
+
+1. make traffic to \*.dev go to localhost (with dnsmasq)
+2. forward traffic on port 80/443 to 22559/22558 (with iptables)
+3. start the prax daemon itself when you log in
+
+
+## 1. Forward \*.dev to localhost
+
+You can do this by putting the prax domain resolver in `/etc/nsswitch.conf`. This won't work with any recent version of Chrome (or Chromium) though as it completely bypasses your name service configuration. (See [prax issue #117](https://github.com/ysbaddaden/prax/issues/117) for more info.)
+
+Luckily Dnsmasq provides a solution. Dnsmasq acts like a local caching DNS server. It can do a lot more though; you should check it out.
+
+```shell
+sudo pacman -S dnsmasq
+# and make sure it is running
+```
+
+To configure Dnsmasq to forward \*.dev you can use the file [dnsmasq](../dnsmasq) that is present in the install directory. Copy it to the right location: `/etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/prax` and restart NetworkManager.
+
+```shell
+sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager.service
+```
+
+## 2. Set up iptables
+
+A systemd-service has been provided that is meant to run `prax-iptables` on startup. Copy this file to `/etc/systemd/system/prax-iptables.service`.
+
+You should also enable and start the service with `systemctl`.
+
+## 3. Start Prax when you log in
+
+*Option 1:* Let your desktop manager start Prax. Copy [prax.desktop](../prax.desktop) to `~/.config/autostart/`. Gnome will automatically run it when you log in. This is the way ysbaddaden runs it. I don't know what it does when you log in twice (with mutliple X-servers). However this should probably not be a real problem I guess.
+
+*Option 2:* Let the per-user systemd instance handle it. Copy [prax.service](../prax.service) to `~/.config/systemd/user/prax.service` and change the lines that say `ExecStart` and `ExecStop` to reflect the correct path where you installed Prax. Note that this is a per-user process, and not per-session.
+
+Note that you should also enable and start this service with `systemctl --user`.
